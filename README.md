# yolov3
tensorflow implementation of yolo v3 using keras for M1 GPU, 

most the codes were copied from https://github.com/pythonlessons/TensorFlow-2.x-YOLOv3. I had only debug some compatabilities issues so that it can run on tensorflow 2.5 which is the only available tf version for M1 GPUs currently
